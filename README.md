This is my Tic Tac Toe project in C++.

I'm having trouble in Visual Studio 2022 with this. I've been able to run it successfully in the default repository folder, but for some reason I can't push that repository to GitHub. I keep getting a "Permission Denied" error.

When I created a copy in a new folder I was able to push all the code to the GitHub repo successfully, but now I can't ge that file to run in the local debugger.

Any tips on that would be appreciated!
